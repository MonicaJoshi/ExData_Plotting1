The purpose of this exercise is to prepare a tidy data & plot quick graphs that may help understand the data better, make quick inferences and throw some light on how to proceed on actual data analysis. 

***Setup & Usage***

1. Download the data source from

2. Unzip the data into your current working directory
sample path after extaction:
"C:\R\exdata-data-household_power_consumption\household_power_consumption"
3. Download the R script files into your current working directory 
sample current working dir: "C:\R\"

4. Load the source files into work space and that should generate png device plots.
example: 
>source("Plot4.R")
5. Plots will be created in source director of data
example: 
"C:\R\exdata-data-household_power_consumption\household_power_consumption\plot4.png"

Using the 4 plot scripts, following four plots can be reproduced:


### Plot 1


![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/unnamed-chunk-2.png) 


### Plot 2

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3](figure/unnamed-chunk-3.png) 


### Plot 3

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](figure/unnamed-chunk-4.png) 


### Plot 4

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](figure/unnamed-chunk-5.png)
